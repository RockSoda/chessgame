## Description:

This application is wrote by Javascript.It can run in mutiple-platforms, it is a hybrid application.
The AI part, using minmax-alaphbeta pruning alorithm to do.
A chess game may allow user to play verses AI

  ### About AI
  
  It is applied minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
  The depth of algorithm is 1, 3 and 5. This application allow the user adjust the difficult of AI.
  In the game user interface, we can see easy, middle, hard options that represents the different AI (the depth of minmax algorithm)
  
  ### About Algorithm(minimax alpha-beat pruning)
  A minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm for choosing the next move in an n-player game, usually a two-player game. 
  Alpha–beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree.
  For example:

## Work Cycle:

  ### Cycle 1
  
  * Make the chess board and set pieces on the board
  
  ### Cycle 2
  
  * Set up the rules for each pieces
  
  ### Cycle 3
  
  * Apply AI to the chessboard
  
  ### Cycle 4
  
  * Implement depths for AI
    
  ### Cycle 5
  
  * Build user interface
